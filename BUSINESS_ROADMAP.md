# 🇮🇳 Bond Liquidity Heatmap - Business Roadmap

## Executive Summary
Real-time bond liquidity monitoring platform for Indian markets, helping traders identify depth and avoid over-paying on odd-lot trades.

## Problem Statement
- Corporate-bond traders in India can see trades within 15 minutes (SEBI rules)
- But desks can't quickly identify where real buying/selling depth exists
- Wrong guesses lead to over-paying or under-selling on odd-lot trades
- Current solutions: Bloomberg/Refinitiv (expensive, lagged) or end-of-day CSVs (useless for real-time)

## Solution: Bond Liquidity Heatmap
**Simple web screen showing:**
- Color-coded grid: Rating (AAA, AA, A) × Tenor (0-1y, 1-3y, 3-5y, 5-10y, 10y+)
- Green: High liquidity, tight spreads
- Red: Low liquidity, wide spreads  
- Yellow: Moderate conditions
- Refreshes every 15 minutes

## Technical Architecture

### Current Prototype (Fixed)
✅ **Data Generation**: Synthetic trade data with realistic patterns  
✅ **Depth Scoring**: `Volume ÷ (Spread × Time Since Last Trade)`  
✅ **UI**: Streamlit heatmap with color coding  
✅ **Database**: SQLite for development
